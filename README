LuaJIT experimental
-------------------
Mostly 5.2 complete, with bits of 5.3.
i386/x64 only (other archs are adhoc ported per demand)

No handholding, here be dragons ahead. This fork tracks Mike's bleeding
edge repo, with lots of its own fragile hacks mixed in.

There are no releases planned as of yet - development, testing, deployment all
happens in rolling fashion from git head (with reverts to put out inevitable
occasional fires). Users are expected to be capable of git bisect when asking
for support.

Definitely not for the faint of the heart, especially if you're looking for
"stable 5.2 Luajit" to ship with your product.
